    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sarvesh Kale, an electronics engineer with a passion for designing and building complex systems and devices. 
    I have a Masters degree in electrical engineering from IIT Bombay. 
    <!and I have experience working in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.>
    </p>
    <p>In my current role as an Application Support Engineer 2 at MathWorks Inc India, I am responsible for solving queries related 
    to software provided by MathWorks and help customer achieve their vision and accelerating the pace of Science and technology. I have also developed
    examples in hdlcoder toolbox. Prior to joining 
    MathWorks, I was a Research Assistant at IIT Bombay in the Department of Electrical Engineering. I was Associated with Wadhwani Electronics Lab 
    and AiCAS Lab at IIT B. I have helped professors in the following Laboratory courses. 
    </p>
    <h2>TA Courses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analog Circuits Lab</li>
      <li>Basic Electrical and Electronics Lab</li>
      <li>Micrcontroller and Microprocessor Lab</li>
    </ul>
    My job was to ensure smooth conduct of practicals and help students in debugging circuit and taking their Viva. My role 
    at AiCAS Lab was to design a digital correlator on FPGA for GPS System (the toughest project I have worked on till date!.)
    </p>
    <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I love to code in Assembly and find it fancy (call me old school!)</li>
      <li>Design and testing of analog and digital circuits</li>
      <li>Firmware development for microcontrollers in Assembly(e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi)</li>
      <li>Debugging of hardware using oscilloscopes and other test equipment</li>
      <li>Experience with industry-standard CAD tools (e.g. KiCad)</li>
      <li>Experience with industry-standard simulation and analysis tools (e.g. LTspice, NGSpice, MATLAB and Simulink)</li>
      <li>Devbelopment with Xilinx FPGAs for Embedded Application.(ZC706)</li>
    </ul>
